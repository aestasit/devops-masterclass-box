## Build

Boxes are generated with Packer 1.4.0 and AWS, VirtualBox 5.2, Hyper-V, VMWare Workstation Pro.

In order to save the build log, it's worth setting the following environment variables:

    PACKER_LOG=1
    PACKER_LOG_PATH=devops-ubuntu-16.04-aws.log

To start the build, use the following command:

    packer build -force boxes/devops-ubuntu-16.04-aws.json

**NOTE:** Packer build files for AWS may need to be updated with the latest AMI ID for your region. Find the latest AMI ID at <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/>.

**NOTE:** Before you can run Hyper-V build you have to create an external switch connected to the network card that is connected to the Internet with DHCP capability and name that router "external-wifi".

## Vagrant
